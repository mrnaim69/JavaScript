// Variable in JavaScript 

console.log("Hello World!");

const firstProgramme = "Hello World!";

console.log(firstProgramme);


// Variable ( var , let , const )

//var myName = "Muhammad Naimur";

// var isn't recommend at all

let myName = "Muhmmad Naimur";

console.log(myName);

myName = "Naim";

const myGoal = "Full Stack Web Developer ";


console.log("My name is " + myName + ". My goal is to be a " + myGoal);


console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My goal is to be a ${myGoal}`);


// Template Literals ``


// myGoal = "Naim"; it is not possible because we cann't re-assign a const variable 


// Recommendation 

// Always use let and const 

// let for simple variable and const for constant variable
